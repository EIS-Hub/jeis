### Assignment: 
The main goal is to implement a LIF-neuron model in JAX. Go through all three tutorials, 
create a notebook for each, replicate the code and play around with it while at the same time 
try to understand the funadmental concepts of SNNs. 
While understanding the concepts, try to keep in mind to implement a LIF-neuron model in JAX 
using your aquired knowledge from the JAX tutorials.

&rarr; For this, there are two sub-assignments that might be helpful:
1. In the JAX-documentation, try to understand the functioning of the different loop-functions of JAX,
namely "jax.lax.fori_loop(), jax.lax.scan(), and jax.lax.while_loop()".
2. In the python documentation, try to understand the different timing functions, 
namely "time" and "timeit", and write down their main differences.
